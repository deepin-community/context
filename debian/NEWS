context (2016.05.14.20160516-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  The ICC profiles normally shipped with context in
  texmf-dist/tex/context/colors/icc/profiles/
  named:
  - ecirgb_v2.icc
  - ecirgb_v2_iccv4.icc
  - isocoated_v2_300_eci.icc
  - isocoated_v2_eci.icc
  - srgb.icc
  - srgb_v4_icc_preference.icc
  have been removed from the distribution as they fall
  under non-free licenses. This means, pdf/x and pdf/a
  creation (and probably some other operations) will
  fail. If one needs these files, please obtain them from
  some other sources and put them into the above directory:

context (2014.05.18.20140520-1) experimental; urgency=low

  The context module "gnuplot" is not shipped in the main context
  package anymore, but in context-modules. If needed, please install
  the (recommended) context-modules package.
