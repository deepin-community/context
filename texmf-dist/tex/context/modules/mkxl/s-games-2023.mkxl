%D This style is a side track of the 2023 X-mas card which is similar
%D but on a 100 by 100 grid. Because the shapes are rather nice and
%D intriguing we decided to see if we could make it into a match them
%D game. So here it is. Maybe at the 2023 \CONTEXT\ meeting we will
%D play a bit with different formulas.

\subject{The addendum to the 2023 X-mas card}

This is a \quote {find matching shapes} game for all ages, inspired by the
\PRAGMA\ 2023 X-mas card. You can invent the rules yourself but this is how we
played it during the holidays:

\startitemize
    \startitem
        We took the (3 by 5, 12 page, complexity 20) version and printed two
        copies on 160-200 gram paper. Any decent printer will scale to fit and it
        looks quite okay on a proper inkjet printer.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        The print is cut into rectangles. You don't need to be too precise but try
        to get through the middle of the white lines. Shuffle the cards and make a
        stack.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        Best let one person lay out the cards slowly till there are some six by
        four on the table and at some point matching pairs will show up.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        Add more card if needed. After a while players will start calling the
        cards names, because human pattern recognition kicks in.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        When a player extracts a match the emptyt spaces will be filled with new
        samples.
    \stopitem
    \startitem
        Of course once you run out of new cards to lay out, the collection of
        pairs speeds up. Some players can catch up at the end.
    \stopitem
\stopitemize

Nothing prohibits to play with three copies and we can make it as complex as
needed. Afterwards you can try to figure out the logic behind the shapes. If
there is demand more variants can be provided and we can introduce more
randomness. Just ask for it on the mailing list.
